GreenGrove Data Visualization Dashboard

GreenGrove is a data visualization dashboard designed to provide insights into user engagement, feedback trends, rewards program participation, ticket resolution metrics, and more. This project uses Flask as the web framework and integrates Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data visualization.
